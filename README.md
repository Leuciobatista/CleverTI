# Full Stack Software Engineering Technical Assessment

This repository contains the solutions for the Feefo Full Stack Software Engineering Technical Assessment. The assessment is divided into three parts: Object-Oriented Programming, UI Assessment, and Web App Restful API System Design.

## Table of Contents
- [Object-Oriented Programming](#object-oriented-programming)
- [UI Assessment](#ui-assessment)
- [Web App Restful API System Design](#web-app-restful-api-system-design)
- [Setup and Run](#setup-and-run)

## Object-Oriented Programming

This section includes a Java project that implements the normalization of job titles.

### Description

Provided with a list of ideal (normalized) job titles, create a class that implements a process that returns the best match when provided with an input string.

#### Example:
- **Input:** "Java engineer"
- **Output:** "Software engineer"

### Files
- `Normaliser.java`: The main class implementing the normalization process.
- `NormaliserTest.java`: Unit tests for the `Normaliser` class.

### How to Run
1. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
2. Run the unit tests to verify the implementation.

## UI Assessment

This section includes a React project that implements the UI components for a note application.

### Description

Implement the design provided in `design.png` as a set of React components. The application includes the ability to create, view, and delete notes.

### Files
- `src/components/`: Contains the React components for the note application.
- `src/tests/`: Contains the unit tests for the React components.
- `design.png`: The design mockup provided.

### How to Run
1. Navigate to the `ui-assessment` directory.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`
4. Run the tests: `npm test`

## Web App Restful API System Design

This section includes the system design for a RESTful API for a note application.

### Description

Consider a simple note web app where a user can write a note, save a note, view a list of their notes, and delete a note. The userâ€™s notes are saved so that they are available via any web-capable device.

### High-Level Design

#### Frontend Components:
- `NoteEditor`
- `NoteList`
- `NoteItem`
- `SaveButton`
- `DeleteButton`

#### Backend Components:
- `NoteController`
- `NoteService`
- `NoteRepository`

#### Database:
- `Notes`
- `Users`

### Restful API

- **GET /notes**: Retrieve all notes of the authenticated user.
- **POST /notes**: Create a new note.
- **DELETE /notes/{id}**: Delete a specific note.
- **PUT /notes/{id}**: Update an existing note.

### Web Server

- Implemented using a framework like Express (Node.js), Spring Boot (Java), or Flask (Python).
- Middleware for authentication.
- CRUD operations for notes.

## Setup and Run

### Java Backend

1. Open the `backend` directory in your preferred Java IDE.
2. Run the unit tests to verify the implementation.

### React Frontend

1. Navigate to the `ui-assessment` directory.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the development server: `npm start`
4. Run the tests: `npm test`

### System Design Documentation

The `system-design` directory contains all the necessary documentation and diagrams for the system design.
